# Jonathan Tran's Portfolio

---

In this README, I'll outline my considerations and decisions regarding the construction of my portfolio, organized into five main sections: Home, About, Projects, Contact, and Footer.

## Home

---

When users first enter my portfolio, I aim for simplicity. Displaying just my name and job title as a "Full Stack Developer" immediately communicates my skills in both front-end and backend development.

#### NavBar

The navigation bar remains simple and fixed to ensure users can navigate to any section effortlessly. By keeping it transparent, users can view the content behind it, maintaining a clean aesthetic.

#### Projects Button

The addition of a "Projects" button allows users to quickly access my portfolio's showcase. This feature caters to potential employers or clients who may want to see my skills in action immediately, streamlining their browsing experience and increasing engagement with my projects.

#### Scroll Down Animation

Incorporating a mouse scroll-down animation serves two purposes: it informs users that the portfolio follows a one-page layout and showcases my ability to implement subtle yet engaging animations.

## About

---

#### Layout

The layout is designed to provide users with immediate visibility into who I am and the skills I possess. Here's how I structured it:

#### Picture and Description

A picture of myself accompanied by a brief description is prominently displayed. To add visual interest and emphasize my job title as a Full Stack Developer, I incorporated different colors into the text.

#### Skills

The skills section is interactive, allowing users to explore the various skills I've acquired. Each skill is presented within a box, enhancing its visibility and making the section more visually appealing. The layout adapts to a column format on mobile devices for improved readability and cleanliness.

## Projects

---

Each project in my portfolio follows a consistent layout to provide users with a clear overview of my work. Here's how I've structured it:

#### Project Layout

- **Screenshot**: A visual representation of the project allows users to get a quick glimpse of its appearance and functionality.
- **Tools Used**: Below the screenshot, I list the tools and technologies used to develop the project. This helps users identify specific skills and technologies utilized in each project.
- **Project Name**: The name of the project is prominently displayed, providing users with a clear identifier for each project.

#### Accessibility and Interaction

Both the screenshot and the project name serve as clickable links, providing easy access to the project for users. Additionally, I've ensured that all elements are hoverable, enhancing interactivity and making the browsing experience more engaging for users.

## Contact

---

In the contact section, I aim to provide users with a convenient and accessible way to reach out to me. Here's how I've designed it:

#### Communication Promise

Users are assured that I will respond to their inquiries as soon as possible after they fill out the form. This helps set clear expectations and encourages users to reach out confidently.

#### Spacious Form Design

The contact form is intentionally designed to be spacious, providing users with ample room to input their information and message. This ensures a comfortable and user-friendly experience, aligning with the overall aesthetic of my portfolio.

#### Validation

The form includes validation to ensure that users provide all necessary information correctly.

## Footer

---

#### Back to Top Button

Placing the "Back to top" button in the footer ensures it doesn't disrupt the page's visual flow and encourages users to explore the entire portfolio before accessing it.

#### Links

Two icons are provided, each opening a new page when clicked. Both icons feature hover effects for added interactivity.

#### Copyright

The copyright notice, including my name and the year, informs visitors about the ownership of the content on the website.
